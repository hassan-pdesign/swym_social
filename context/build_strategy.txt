Build Strategy in Cursor

1. Set up core repo structure early
- app/ → FastAPI + agent logic
- templates/ → Static image templates
- data/ → Example content for local dev
- tests/ → Unit + integration tests

2. Leverage Cursor for:
- Writing + refactoring Pydantic models
- Building agent chains (LangGraph / CrewAI)
- Integrating OpenAI, LlamaIndex, Pillow modules
- Auto-generating tests + validation checks

3. Work in small iterative chunks
- Cursor excels at modular development
- Use AI co-pilot for boilerplate + repetitive tasks
- Keep tight feedback loops: write → run → debug → refine

4. Test locally early + often
- Start with mock data + stubs for APIs
- Focus first on agent flows + image generation
- Delay full API integration until core works

🛠️ Recommended Libraries for Solo Build
- FastAPI + Pydantic → API + models
- LangGraph → agent orchestration
- Pillow (PIL) → static image generation
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo → text generation
- BeautifulSoup / Playwright → content scraping
- Streamlit (optional) → review dashboard MVP

✅ Tips:
- Document everything as you go (Markdown in repo)
- Treat each agent + service as a micro-service / module
- Start with one platform (e.g., LinkedIn) before adding others
